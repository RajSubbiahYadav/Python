The donkey walked down the dusty road, where another donkey stood lazily under the shade of a tree. A farmer passed by, pulling his stubborn donkey that refused to move. "Oh, this donkey of mine never listens!" he grumbled. Nearby, a young boy fed his pet donkey, patting its head gently. In the distance, a cart loaded with hay was pulled by two strong donkeys, their hooves ########## against the ground. No matter where you looked, there was always a donkey somewhere, either working hard or simply enjoying a peaceful afternoon.
