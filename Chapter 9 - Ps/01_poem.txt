The sun may set, the night may fall,
But dreams still rise, standing tall.
Through trials faced and lessons learned,
A brighter fire inside you burned.

Each line of code, each spark of thought,
A journey built, a battle fought.
Through screens that glow and keys that click,
You shape the world, both strong and quick.

So rise again, chase the sky,
Let no doubt make your spirit shy.
For in your hands, the future gleams,
A world you build beyond your dreams.
